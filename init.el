;; environment variables. The way I solve this is by launching Emacs from
;; terminal, which gives Emacs the full environment variables of the invoking
;; terminal. Then I call the `+env-save' command, which reads the environment
;; variables defined in `+env-save-vars' and stores them in
;; "~/.emacs.d/local/system-env.el". This file is then loaded in the future
;; Emacs sessions (launched either from terminal or from GUI) by calling the
;; `+env-load' command.

;; pseudo-modules. After loading Emacs, the `emacs-startup-hook' gets executed,
;; we use this hook to profile the startup time, load the fonts and the theme,
;; and setup the *scratch* buffer content. Lastly we require the
;; `minemacs-loaded' synchronization module, which runs internally the
;; `minemacs-after-startup-hook' hooks and provide `minemacs-loaded' so the
;; packages loaded with `:after minemacs-loaded' can be loaded. The
;; `minemacs-loaded' will require `minemacs-lazy' when Emacs goes idle, this
;; pseudo-module provides `minemacs-lazy' so the packages loaded with `:after
;; minemacs-lazy' can be loaded then it incrementally run the hooks in
;; `minemacs-lazy-hook' when Emacs goes idle.
